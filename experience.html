                                        <p>My trip to Stanford,<br />It came as a sweet testament to my realization that I was selected to attend the Summer Semester at Stanford University during mid-April, 2018. Post the chaos of visa and packing I left India to San Francisco on 20th June. It was a 65 days of pure learning experience. I did the courses &lsquo;Probability for Computer Scientists &ndash; CS109&rsquo; by Prof. Lisa Yan and &lsquo;Data Mining and Analysis - STATS 202&rsquo; by Prof. Rajan Patel (Google). Just two courses in a week did not fill my thirsty soul which wanted to have a all round experience. So, I started applying to visit/attend events/meet people at various companies like Google, Microsoft, Oracle&hellip; to name a few. I also knocked at the doors of many professors at Stanford (many of them I have seen through a screen from across the world at home while doing MOOCs) and asked them if they have any work that I could do and learn from. All these reaped good outcome when I got many optimistic emails from companies. I started visiting various companies, attended events, did some cool activities and met dope people (details below). The best of it all was when I got emails from various Stanford calling me for interviews and talks over lunch. Later did I realize all of those meetings and interviews were meant to check my consistency and provide me an internship at the all famous NASA Ames Research Centre at Palo Alto. I worked for an open source satellite team called &lsquo;Kick Sat - 2&rsquo; as the team lead for GPS. Working for NASA, visiting companies and managing the course work at Stanford was a heavenly and sweet burden. The courses I did were very well structured and interesting. We had a class project to build a search engine for STATS 202 instead of a final exam, giving us a whole hands-on experience on &lsquo;R&rsquo;. Following are all the cool stuff I did at various companies,<br />- Google: Attended the flutter meet up and understand the bts of the google street view.<br />- Microsoft: Attended the workshop on Microsoft Azure to build a chatbot and <br />- Oracle: Attended a workshop on Oracle chatbot<br />- Qualcomm: Attend an event on massive MIMO based devices.<br />- Cisco Meraki: Attended the open house of Cisco Meraki.<br />- Visa: Attended an event on &lsquo;AI in the field of blockchain&rsquo;<br />- AWS: Attended the mobile week at AWS loft.<br />The whole experience was absolutely worth it and has left me with the take-home message &ldquo;You can do anything you want to, if you want to&rdquo;. On that note, I left San Francisco back to the hustle and bustle of VIT with a motivated mind.</p>

                                    <p>Janhavi made a presentation about her ongoing research. Her interests in the field of Neuro-economics was the primary motivation in the work she is carrying out. As part of the research she had developed a portal to conduct a survey related to her topic of interest.&nbsp;<br /><br />The survey named 'PeekAtYou', was launched at the VIThink forum held on 31st August 2018 and&nbsp; it aims at analyzing&nbsp; DISC personality and smartphone affinity of the people.<br />DISC is a behavior assessment tool based on the theory by psychologist William Moulton Marston,which centers around four different behavioral traits:<br />D - Dominance<br />I - Influential<br />S - Steady<br />C - Compliant<br /><br />Data of this survey is being used for studying the affect of Nomophobia in the society.<br />Nomophobia(no mobile phone phobia), as the name says is the fear of not able to use your smartphones. It is the latest lifestyle disorder that is affecting our society.<br /><br />Try the 'PeekAtYou' Survey:<br /><br /><a href="http://peekatyou.000webhostapp.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://Peekatyou.000webhostapp.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1539275569557000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFUiCvtrW452lVZVdsq4r3JFJtcRw" style="color: darkblue">Peekatyou.000webhostapp.com</a></p>
